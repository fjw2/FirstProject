# Investigating a Movie Dataset
This project's purpose was to analyze a dataset using NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to get familiar with the
different libraries python has to offer.  It was a part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

The project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and provides a walkthrough alongside the code to explain 
the entire process.
